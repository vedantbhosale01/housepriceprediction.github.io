# House Price Prediction

Our project is a Machine learning model/app, that will guess the accurate price of your future
house on the basis of certain specifications of your future house. Prediction house prices
are expected to help people who plan to buy a house so they can know the price range in the
future, then they can plan their finances well. In addition, house price predictions are also
beneficial for property investors to know the trend of housing prices in a certain location. In
real estate, so many real-estate companies are hire some experts to predict the price of a
House and suggest that the company invest in that house but sometimes they are not 100%
correct. Sometimes they fail to give accurate predictions about the price of the house. So
we want to create a one ml model that can use to predict the price of this house. it gives 90%
right prediction but accurate prediction about the price of the house because we train that model
with all the previous year's data which predict the approx. but the accurate price of that house using
this ML model. In this project, we use one ML model to predict the price of one specific city's
houses using a data set that is provided on the Kaggle app.
